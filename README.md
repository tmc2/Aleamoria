## Introduction

This is a game prototype made by Cláudia Ferraz and Thiago Chaves using Unity.
The game must be played by a minimum of 4 people using the same PC. (Later versions should allow remote play or that each person have your own screen on a smartphone)
In this game, there should be two teams that competes to see who scores the most. They will try to guess words given to one person at a time, who will send clues by describing it, making a mimic, or even by sound!!!! 

It is a great and fun party game!!

## Usage

You can clone this repository and run it using Unity (built and tested on Unity 2019.2.6f1). Feel free to modify it at your will.

Also, a built project is available in `\docs` which is the source to github pages. So, you can also play the current version simply by accessing https://tmc2.github.io/Aleamoria/.

## RoadMap
### TODOs
 - [ ] Add sound effects
 - [ ] Make an intro animation
 - [ ] Allow the user to enter the players amount by hitting ENTER
 - [ ] New Feature: Add screens in which each player provides 3 Aleamórias
 - [ ] Make thematic datasets and allow users to choose them
 - [ ] Make it server based (each player will have their own screen accordingly)


### Known Issues
 -  WebGL acts weird if the available area is below 720p
 - Large number of players might give the game some problems due to small number of Aleamórias in dataset
