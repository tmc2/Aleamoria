## Introduction

This is a game prototype made by Cláudia Ferraz and Thiago Chaves using Unity.
The game must be played by a minimum of 4 people using the same Android smartphone (as for now).

In this game, there should be two teams that competes to see who scores the most. They will try to guess words given to one person at a time, who will send clues by describing it, making a mimic, or even by sound!!!! 

## Usage

You can clone this repository and run it using Unity (built and tested on Unity 2019.2.6f1). Feel free to modify it at your will.

Also, a built project is available in `\Build\Android` (Aleamória.apk, which has almost 40MB). 

## RoadMap
### TODOs
 - [x] Add sound effects
 - [x] Make an intro animation
 - [x] ~~Allow the user to enter the players amount by hitting ENTER~~
 - [x] New Feature: Add screens in which each player provides 3 Aleamórias
 - [x] Port to Android
 - [x] Explain the rules in a ludic way (animation/video)
 - [ ] Make thematic datasets and allow users to choose them
 - [ ] ~~Make it server based (each player will have their own screen accordingly)~~


### Known Issues
 - Large number of players might give the game some problems due to small number of Aleamórias in dataset
